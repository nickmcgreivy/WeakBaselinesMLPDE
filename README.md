# Weak baselines: machine learning (ML) for partial differential equation (PDE) solving research

## System requirements

This code has been tested with MacOS, though we expect it to also work for Linux. This code requires command line to run. We have tested this code on Python v3.7 and v3.9. All required software can be downloaded using open-source package managers. 

## Installation guide

Begin by making a new anaconda environment. First, type `conda create -n pdeenv python=3.9` into command line.
